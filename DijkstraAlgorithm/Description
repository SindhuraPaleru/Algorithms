Description:

Dijkstra's algorithm finds the length of an shortest path between two vertices in a graph.
1. Choose the source vertex
2. Define a set S of vertices, and initialize it to empty set. As the algorithm progresses, the set S will store those vertices to which a shortest path has been found.
3. Label the source vertex with 0, and insert it into S.
4. Consider each vertex not in S connected by an edge from the newly inserted vertex. Label the vertex not in S with the label of the newly inserted vertex + the length of the edge.
o But if the vertex not in S was already labeled, its new label will be min(label of newly inserted vertex + length of edge, old label)
5. Pick a vertex not in S with the smallest label, and add it to S.
6. Repeat from step 4, until the destination vertex is in S or there are no labeled vertices not in S.
If the destination is labeled, its label is the distance from source to destination. If it is not labeled, there is no path from the source to the destination.
