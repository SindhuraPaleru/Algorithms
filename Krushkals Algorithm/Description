Kruskal's algorithm is an algorithm in graph theory that finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph. This means it finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized. If the graph is not connected, then it finds a minimum spanning forest. Kruskal's algorithm is an example of a greedy algorithm Description
 Create a forest T (a set of trees), where each vertex in the graph is a separate tree
 Create a set S containing all the edges in the graph
 While S is non empty and T is not yet spanning

o remove an edge with minimum weight from S
o if that edge connects two different trees, then add it to the forest, combining two trees into a single tree, otherwise discard that edge. At the termination of the algorithm, the forest has only one component and forms a minimum spanning tree of the graph.
