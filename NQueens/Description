n queens are to be placed on an n x n chess board so that no two queens attack each other i.e there are not in the same column ,not in same row and not in the same diagonal
For an 8 by 8 chess board there are approximately 4.4 billion 8-tuples to examine.
Placement of queens on distinct rows and columns we require the examination of at most 8! i.e 40320.
Solution:
 The solution vector X (X1…Xn) represents a solution in which Xi is the column of the th row where I th queen is placed.
 First, we have to check no two queens are in same row.
 Second, we have to check no two queens are in same column.
 The function, which is used to check these two conditions, is [I, X (j)], which gives position of the I th queen, where I represents the row and X (j) represents the column position.
 Third, we have to check no two queens are in it diagonal.
 Consider two dimensional array A[1:n,1:n] in which we observe that every element on the same diagonal that runs from upper left to lower right has the same value.
 Also, every element on the same diagonal that runs from lower right to upper left has the same value.
 Suppose two queens are in same position (i,j) and (k,l) then two queens lie on the same diagonal , if and only if |j-l|=|I-k|.
