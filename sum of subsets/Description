We are given ‘n’ positive numbers called weights and we have to find all combinations of these numbers whose sum is M. this is called sum of subsets problem.
If we consider backtracking procedure using fixed tuple strategy , the elements X(i) of the solution vector is either 1 or 0 depending on if the weight W(i) is included or not.
If the state space tree of the solution, for a node at level I, the left child corresponds to X(i)=1 and right to X(i)=0.
